                    Our users tend to get tired of constantly digging to find music that fits their needs and are
                    in search of quality music that accurately reflects how they feel. Our solution is to get
                    away from the mainstream music applications such as YouTube, Spotify and Apple Music,
                    and provide a way for users to effortlessly sift through the musical underground.

                        My group and I decided to work on a bunch of ideas to help our app thrive to bring out the Musical Underground. This was really fun to see all the ideas actually put out there!
